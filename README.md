# LYDateReminder
help to remind date. a bug is when the day past the future list won't change.

I use a Dic to save matters. While I want to move the element in @"future" to "memory" (I used for(;;) instead of forin), there's an error shows that i can't move it while enumating arrays. Could anyone solve it ?
